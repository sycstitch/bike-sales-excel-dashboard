# üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Bike Sales (Excel Web)
This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis skills using Excel Web ‚Äî from messy raw data to an interactive dashboard that reveals purchasing patterns.

## The Big Question:
Who bought bikes and who didn't? What specific factors made the difference in purchase decisions?

**Key Insights Discovered:**
- Income differences between bike buyers and non-buyers across genders
- Commute distance impact on purchase decisions
- Age demographics driving bike sales

## Dashboard in Action
Here's a look at the dashboard in action. I had to restart this entire project at one point because Excel Web wouldn't let me create slicers from graphs, nor copy pivot tables between sheets. The workaround involved placing all pivot tables and visuals on the same sheet, then hiding the pivot tables.
