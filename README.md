# üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Bike Sales (& the Hidden Battle with Excel Web)
This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis skills using Excel Web ‚Äî from messy raw data to an interactive dashboard that reveals purchasing patterns.

## The Big Question:
Who bought bikes and who didn't? What specific factors made the difference in purchase decisions?

**Key Insights Discovered:**
- Income differences between bike buyers and non-buyers across genders
- Commute distance impact on purchase decisions
- Age demographics driving bike sales

## Dashboard in Action
Here's a look at the dashboard in action. I had to restart this entire project at one point because Excel Web decided slicers from graphs were a no-go, and copying pivot tables between sheets was a pipe dream. The workaround involved placing all pivot tables and visuals on the same sheet.
